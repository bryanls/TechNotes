Previously, to create a React application Create-React-App (CRA) was used. Nowadays is better to use Vite (pronunced as Veet)

To create an app with Vite:
```shell
npm create vite@5.2.3 # vite@lastest for the lastest version

cd react-app
npm install # npm i
npm run dev

code . # To open the project in Visual Studio Code
```

node_modules: contains all the dependencies of the current project
public: contains all the public files and that can be accessed by the user/project, like the image logo
